# Fate Dice Roller

This little bot rolls 4dF and adds an optional number to the total. If the result falls on the Fate ladder the output includes the correct adjective!

## Using the Bot

You can head over to the [webpage](https://fatebot.carrd.co/) for Fate Bot for more info.

[Invite Fate Bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=763485934028718110&scope=bot&permissions=280640).

Once the bot is in your server, you should see all the slash commands ready to go!

## Making Your Own

If you wish to fork this and make your own bot, you need to add a `.envrc` to your codebase (to be ignored by git).

This file needs the following key/value pairs:

* `TOKEN`
* `APP_ID`
* `PUB_KEY`
